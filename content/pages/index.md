# Hello there,

I create practical and robust **web apps**.

Roughly half the year I work as an **independent contractor**. The rest of my time I spend on **family**, **learning** and **open source**.

I am also trying to get back into **speaking** about tech and coding.

My full name is Benedicte Raae.  
My location is Rodel√∏kka, Oslo, Norway.

## @raae/gatsby-remark-oembed

In the fall of 2018 I released my first and so far only open source project. Its been a blast with contribution already from Thailand, Canada and the UK.

The project is a plugin for GatsbyJS that lets you embed content from Twitter, CodePen, YouTube, Instagram, SoundCloud and more using the oembed protocol.

## Speaking

In 2019 I would like to get serious about speaking!

I have spoken at several meetups and done two conference lightning talks in Oslo over the years, but I would like to get to become an international speaker and need practice. Lots of practice.

Things I could talk about include: Gatsby, React, @raae/gatsby-remark-oembed, Building MVPs in record time, web apps vs. native apps, structured content, the oembed protocol and more.

I am having a hard time coming up with talk angles, so if you are in need of a talk on one of these topics [let med know](mailto://raae@raae.codes) and we could brainstorm together.

## Client work

I have been working as an independent contractor since 2010. These days I focus on making web apps with a visualization component.

I have experience with a myriad of technologies, but these days I focus on **React**, **Gatsby** and **D3**.

Currently I am creating a web app for Thales to help monitor and visualize tactical defense networks.

From the fall of 2013 to the spring of 2019 I made and maintained the Varsom app for The Norwegian Water Resources and Energy Directorate. First as a native iOS app, but later as a hybrid app on both Android and iOS.

I am available for long term 60% contracts from the fall of 2020, preferably as part of a remote first team.
